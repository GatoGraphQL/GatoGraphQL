# Gato GraphQL

Gato GraphQL is a **tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site**. You can think of it as a Swiss Army knife for dealing with data, as it allows to retrieve, manipulate and store again any piece of data, in any desired way, using the [GraphQL language](https://graphql.org/).

With Gato GraphQL, you can:

- Query data to create headless sites
- Expose public and private APIs
- Map JS components to Gutenberg blocks
- Synchronize content across sites
- Automate tasks
- Complement WP-CLI to execute admin tasks
- Search/replace content for site migrations
- Send notifications when something happens (new post published, new comment added, etc)
- Interact with cloud services
- Convert the data from a 3rd-party API into the required format
- Translate content in the site
- Update thousands of posts with a single action
- Insert or remove Gutenberg blocks in bulk
- Validate that a new post contains a mandatory block
- And much more...

Check out the [Tutorial section in gatographql.com](https://gatographql.com/tutorial/intro) which demonstrates how to implement these use cases using the plugin.

</details>

## Development Requirements

- PHP 8.1
- [Lando](https://lando.dev/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Recommended to use

- [XDebug](https://xdebug.org/) (integrated out of the box when using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [PHP Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xdebug.php-debug) addon for VSCode)

## Install for Development

Follow these steps:

### Clone repo locally

Clone the repo in your local drive:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL
```

### Install Composer dependencies

Run:

```bash
$ cd {project folder}
$ cd submodules/GatoGraphQL && composer install && cd ../.. && composer install
```

## Run the webserver for DEV

A Lando webserver for development is already set-up:

- Runs on PHP 8.1
- It directly uses the source code on the repo
- XDebug is enabled

Follow these steps:

### Build the Lando webserver for DEV

Run (only the first time):

```bash
composer build-server
```

After a few minutes, the website will be available under `https://gatographql.lndo.site`.

To print the server information, including the port to connect to the MySql database (so you can visualize and edit the data in the DB using an external client, such as MySQLWorkbench), run:

```bash
composer server-info
```

<details>

<summary>What plugins are installed in the webserver? ðŸ¤”</summary>

- [Gato GraphQL](layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gatographql/gatographql.php)
- [Gato GraphQL - Testing](layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/phpunit-plugins/gatographql-testing/gatographql-testing.php)
- [Gato GraphQL - Testing Schema](layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/testing-schema/gatographql-testing-schema.php)

(The last two are utilities to run integration tests for Gato GraphQL. Among others, they provide CPT "dummy-cpt" and custom taxonomies "dummy-category" and "dummy-tag").

</details>

### Log-in to the `wp-admin`

Credentials for `https://gatographql.lndo.site/wp-admin/`:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

### Open the Gato GraphQL plugin in the `wp-admin`

Click on the Gato GraphQL link on the menu to open the GraphiQL client, and execute the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

If the installation of the webserver was successful, you will receive a response:

![GraphQL response in the Lando webserver](layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gatographql/.wordpress-org/screenshot-1.png)

### Run Integration Tests

Run:

``` bash
composer integration-test
```

### Start the Lando webserver for DEV

Building the webserver (above) is needed only the first time.

From then on, run:

```bash
composer init-server
```

## Run the webserver for PROD

A Lando webserver is set-up and configured to test the released plugins, generated by GitHub Actions.

- Runs on PHP 7.2
- You must download the generated plugins for PROD (from GitHub Actions) and install them on the webserver
- XDebug is not enabled

Follow these steps:

### Build the Lando webserver for PROD

Run (only the first time):

```bash
composer build-server-prod
```

After a few minutes, the website will be available under `https://gatographql-for-prod.lndo.site`.

(The URL is the same one as for DEV above, plus appending `-for-prod` to the domain name.)

To print the server information, run:

```bash
composer server-info-prod
```

The `wp-admin` login credentials are the same ones as for DEV.

### Start the Lando webserver for PROD

Building the webserver (above) is needed only the first time.

From then on, run:

```bash
composer init-server-prod
```

## Manage the Lando webservers

### Re-install the WordPress site (DEV and PROD)

You can at any moment re-install the WordPress site (and import the initial dataset).

On the DEV webserver:

```bash
composer reset-db
```

On PROD:

```bash
composer reset-db-prod
```

This is useful when:

- The installation when doing `build-server` was halted midway (or failed for some reason)
- Running the integration tests was not completed (modifying the DB data to a different state, so that running the tests again will fail)

### Re-build the Lando webserver for DEV

When a plugin or package folder has been renamed, you need to update the path in the `overrides` section of the [`.lando.upstream.yml`](webservers/gatographql/.lando.upstream.yml) Lando config file, and then rebuild the Lando webserver to reflect these changes.

Run:

```bash
composer rebuild-server
```

### Regenerate the Composer autoload files for DEV

When a new plugin is added to the monorepo, it must have its Composer autoload file generated, and the plugin must be symlinked to the Lando webserver.

Run:

```bash
composer rebuild-app-and-server
```

## Releasing the plugins for PROD

_(This is done by the [admin of the repo][link-author].)_

The monorepo includes scripts that completely automate the process of releasing the plugins in the monorepo.

Follow these steps:

### Tag the monorepo as `patch`, `minor` or `major`

Choose which version you will be releasing. The same version will be applied to all plugins in the monorepo.

_(Given that the current version is `0.0.0`...)_

To release version `0.0.1`, run:

```bash
composer release-patch
```

To release version `0.1.0`, run:

```bash
composer release-minor
```

To release version `1.0.0`, run:

```bash
composer release-major
```

<details>

<summary>What do these commands do? ðŸ¤”</summary>

Executing these commands will first prepare the repo for PROD:

- Update the version (in the plugin file's header, readme.txt's Stable tag, others) for all the extension plugins in the monorepo
- Update the documentation image URLs to point to that tag, under `raw.githubusercontent.com`
- Commit and push
- Git tag with the version, and push tag to GitHub

And then, it will prepare the repo for DEV again:

- Update the version to the next DEV version (next semver + `-dev`)
- Commit and push

</details>

To preview running the command without actually executing it, append `-- --dry-run`:

```bash
composer release-patch -- --dry-run
```

### Create release from tag in GitHub

After tagging the repo on the step above, we must create a release from the tag to generate the extension plugins for production.

To create the release, we must head over to the [`tags` page in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/tags), and click on the new tag (eg: `0.1.0`).

Then, on the tag page, click on `Create release from tag`.

![Create release from tag](assets/img/create-release-from-tag.png)

This will trigger the [`generate_plugins.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/actions/workflows/generate_plugins.yml) workflow, which will generate the extension plugins and attach them as assets to the tag page.

For instance, after tagging Gato GraphQL with `1.0.9`, the tag page [GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/tag/1.0.9](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/tag/1.0.9) had the following assets attached to it:

- `gatographql-1.0.9.zip`
- `gatographql-testing-1.0.9.zip`
- `gatographql-testing-schema-1.0.9.zip`

### Install the extension in the PROD webserver

Once the extension plugin has been generated, install it on the PROD webserver to test it, whether manually or using WP-CLI.

Using WP-CLI, to test the released version `0.1.0`, run:

```bash
$ cd webservers/gatographql-for-prod
$ lando wp plugin install https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/latest/download/gatographql-0.1.0.zip --force --activate
$ cd ../..
```

### Query the extension in the `wp-admin`

Once you've installed the release on the Lando webserver for PROD, log-in to the `wp-admin`, access the GraphiQL client, and execute the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

If the installation of the webserver was successful, you will receive a response:

![GraphQL response in the Lando webserver](layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gatographql/.wordpress-org/screenshot-1.png)

### Run Integration Tests for PROD

Run:

``` bash
composer integration-test-prod
```

## Development Process

### Purging the cache

When developing the plugin and testing it in the DEV webserver, whenever we create a new PHP service or modify the signature of an existing one (such as the PHP classname), we need to purge the container cache.

Run:

```bash
composer purge-cache
```

<details>

<summary>How does Gato GraphQL use a service container? ðŸ¤”</summary>

The Gato GraphQL plugin uses a service container (via the [Symfony DependencyInjection](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html) library), to manage all services in PHP.

Services are PHP classes, and must be defined in configuration files `services.yaml` and `schema-services.yaml` to be injected into the container.

The first time the application is invoked, the container gathers all injected services and compiles them, generating a single PHP file that is loaded in the application.

Generating this file can take several seconds. To avoid waiting for this time on each request, the Gato GraphQL plugin caches this file after it has been generated the first time.

The container needs to be purged whenever a service is created, or an existing one updated or removed.

(In production, the Gato GraphQL plugin purges the cache whenever a new extension plugin is activated, or when the plugin Settings are updated. During development, it can in addition be triggered manually, by running `composer purge-cache`.)

This applies to resolvers (type resolvers, field resolvers, directive resolvers, and any other resolver that gives shape to the GraphQL schema), as these are PHP services. Whenever a resolver is added or removed, or is updated in such a way that modifies the GraphQL schema, the cached container must be purged.

Some example resolvers are:

- `String` type: [`StringScalarTypeResolver`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/1.0.0/layers/Engine/packages/component-model/src/TypeResolvers/ScalarType/StringScalarTypeResolver.php)
- Field `User.name` (and others): [`UserObjectTypeFieldResolver`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/1.0.0/layers/CMSSchema/packages/users/src/FieldResolvers/ObjectType/UserObjectTypeFieldResolver.php)
- `@skip` directive: [`SkipFieldDirectiveResolver`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/1.0.0/layers/Engine/packages/engine/src/DirectiveResolvers/SkipFieldDirectiveResolver.php)

</details>

### Regenerating the monorepo configuration

After adding a plugin or package to the monorepo, the configuration (containing all the packages) must be regenerated.

Run:

```bash
composer update-monorepo-config
```

<details>

<summary>What does command <code>update-monorepo-config</code> do? ðŸ¤”</summary>

The `update-monorepo-config` command will:

- Regenerate the root `composer.json`, adding the new packages
- Regenerate the root `phpstan.neon`, adding the new packages

</details>

## Development Tools

### Error logs

Access the error logs from the Lando webserver:

```bash
composer log-server-errors
```

For PROD:

```bash
composer log-server-errors-prod
```

### SSH

SSH into the Lando webserver:

```bash
composer ssh-server
```

For PROD:

```bash
composer ssh-server-prod
```

## Debugging

XDebug is already integrated when using VSCode.

Add a breakpoint in the source code and then, in the `Run and Debug` tab, press on `Start Debugging` with the corresponding configuration (defined in [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json)):

- `[Lando webserver] Listen for Xdebug`: For debugging the source code while running the Lando webserver for DEV
- `[PHPUnit] Listen for Xdebug`: For debugging PHPUnit tests

XDebug is enabled but inactive; it must be activated when requesting the webpage (see below).

### Debugging in the Lando webserver for DEV

Activate XDebug for a request by appending parameter `?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` to the URL (for any page on the Gato GraphQL plugin, including any page in the wp-admin, the GraphiQL or Interactive Schema public clients, or other).

For instance:

- `https://gatographql.lndo.site/wp-admin/edit.php?page=gatographql&action=execute_query&XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1`
- `https://gatographql.lndo.site/graphiql/?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1`

### Debugging PHPUnit tests

Activate XDebug by prepending `XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` before the `phpunit` command to run the unit tests.

For instance:

```bash
XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1 vendor/bin/phpunit layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/phpunit-packages/gatographql/tests/Unit/Faker/WPFakerFixtureQueryExecutionGraphQLServerTest.php
```
