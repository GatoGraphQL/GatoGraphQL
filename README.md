# Gato GraphQL

Gato GraphQL is a **tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site**. You can think of it as a Swiss Army Knife for dealing with data, as it allows to retrieve, manipulate and store again any piece of data, in any desired way, using the [GraphQL language](https://graphql.org/).

With Gato GraphQL, you can:

- Query data to create headless sites
- Expose public and private APIs
- Map JS components to Gutenberg blocks
- Synchronize content across sites
- Automate tasks
- Complement WP-CLI to execute admin tasks
- Search/replace content for site migrations
- Send notifications when something happens (new post published, new comment added, etc)
- Interact with cloud services
- Convert the data from a 3rd-party API into the required format
- Translate content in the site
- Update thousands of posts with a single action
- Insert or remove Gutenberg blocks in bulk
- Validate that a new post contains a mandatory block
- And much more...

Check out the [Recipes section in gatographql.com](https://gatographql.com/recipes/intro) to browse examples demonstrating these use cases.

We can create multiple custom endpoints, each for a different target:

Endpoints are configured via Schema Configurations:

We can create many Schema Configurations, customizing them for different users or applications:

## Installing the Gato GraphQL plugin in WordPress

_For alternative installation methods, check [Installing Gato GraphQL](docs/installing-gatographql-for-wordpress.md)._

Download the latest release of the plugin<!-- @todo Fix when plugin released in wp.org [the latest release of the plugin][latest-release-url]--> as a .zip file.

Then, in the WordPress admin:

- Go to `Plugins => Add New`
- Click on `Upload Plugin`
- Select the .zip file
- Click on `Install Now` (it may take a few minutes)
- Once installed, click on `Activate`

Requirements:

- WordPress 5.4+
- PHP 7.2+

## Development

Check instructions in: [Setting-up the development environment](docs/development-environment.md).

### Supported PHP features

Check the list of [Supported PHP features](docs/supported-php-features.md)

### Gutenberg JS builds

Compiled JavaScript code (such as all files under a block's `build/` folder) is added to the repo, but only as compiled for production, i.e. after running `npm run build`.

Code compiled for development, i.e. after running `npm start`, cannot be commited/pushed to the repo.
