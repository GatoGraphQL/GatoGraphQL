The #1 Activity Log plugin helps you monitor & log all changes and activities on your site, so you can run a safer, more organized WordPress site.

== Description ==

A COMPLETE, EASY TO USE, STABLE AND WELL SUPPORTED WORDPRESS ACTIVITY LOG PLUGIN

Want to monitor and track your site activity? Find out exactly who does what on your WordPress website. the Activity Log plugin is like an airplane's black box that logs every activity in WordPress, and lets you see exactly what people are doing on your site.

* Like, if someone is trying to hack your site.
* Or, when a post was published, and who published it.
* Or, if a plugin was activated/deactivated.

Useful, right? Trust us, you won't understand how you managed your website without it. The plugin is also lightning fast and works behind the scenes, so it doesn't affect site and admin performance (For optimal performance, we built the plugin so it runs on a separate table in the database).

If you have tens of users or more, you really can’t know who did what. This plugin tries to solve this issue by tracking what users do, and displaying it in an easy to use and easy to filter view on the dashboard of your WordPress site.

<h4>With the Activity Log you can log:</h4>
* <strong>WordPress</strong> - Core Updates
* <strong>Posts</strong> - Created, Updated, Deleted
* <strong>Pages</strong> - Created, Updated, Deleted
* <strong>Custom Post Type</strong> - Created, Updated, Deleted
* <strong>Tags</strong> - Created, Edited, Deleted
* <strong>Categories</strong> - Created, Edited, Deleted
* <strong>Taxonomies</strong> - Created, Edited, Deleted
* <strong>Comments</strong> - Created, Approved, Unproved, Trashed, Untrashed, Spammed, Unspammed, Deleted
* <strong>Media</strong> - Uploaded, Edited, Deleted
* <strong>Users</strong> - Login, Logout, Login has failed, Update profile, Registered and Deleted
* <strong>Plugins</strong> - Installed, Updated, Activated, Deactivated, Changed
* <strong>Themes</strong> - Installed, Updated, Deleted, Activated, Changed (Editor and Customizer)
* <strong>Widgets</strong> - Added to a sidebar / Deleted from a sidebar, Order widgets
* <strong>Menus</strong> - A menu is being Created, Updated, Deleted
* <strong>Setting</strong> - General, Writing, Reading, Discussion, Media, Permalinks
* <strong>Options</strong> - Can be extend by east filter
* <strong>Export</strong> - User download export file from the site
* <strong>WooCommerce</strong> - Monitor all shop options
* <strong>bbPress</strong> - Forums, Topics, Replies, Taxonomies and other actions
* There's more, but you get the point...

<strong>New!</strong> You are now able to get email notifications once an event you have defined (via rules) has occurred. This is useful in cases you must know right away when someone does something on your site. We use it to thwart hacker attempts, for example.

The plugin does not require any kind of setup. It works out of the box (and that’s another reason people love it).

We’re planning to add a lot more features in the upcoming releases. If you think we’re missing something big time, please post your suggestions in the plugin’s forum.
