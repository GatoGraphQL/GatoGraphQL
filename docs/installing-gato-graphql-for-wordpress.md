# Installing Gato GraphQL

These are the several ways to install the [Gato GraphQL](../layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gato-graphql-for-wp) plugin.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.4+
- PHP 7.1+

## Plugin

Download [the latest release of the plugin][latest-release-url] as a .zip file.

Then, in the WordPress admin:

- Go to `Plugins => Add New`
- Click on `Upload Plugin`
- Select the .zip file
- Click on `Install Now` (it may take a few minutes)
- Once installed, click on `Activate`

### Timeout in Nginx?

Nginx has a time limit to process the response from the PHP backend, and installing large WordPress plugins may exceed the default time limit.

If when installing the plugin you get a "504 Gateway Timeout" error, or an entry `"upstream timed out (110: Connection timed out) while reading upstream"` in the log, increase the timeout to `300` seconds in the Nginx config, as [explained here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/504-gateway-time-out-504-gateway-time-out-nginx/#post-13423918).

## Composer

Add the following configuration to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "gato-graphql/gato-graphql-for-wp": "^1"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "repositories": [

                    "type": "zip"
                },
                "require": {
