# How transpiling works

Transpiling converts code from PHP 8.1 to 7.1. Then,

- The project uses PHP 8.1 for development
- The code is converted to PHP 7.1 when generating the plugins for production

For instance, PHP 8.0's union types, are converted [from this code](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/b9d379dc34195701e3afac2be4c132da6728ab75/layers/Schema/packages/custompost-mutations/src/TypeAPIs/CustomPostTypeAPIInterface.php#L18) in development:

```php
interface CustomPostTypeAPIInterface
{
  public function createCustomPost(array $data): string | int | null | Error;
}
```

into this code for production:

```php
interface CustomPostTypeAPIInterface
{
  public function createCustomPost(array $data)
}
```

Transpiling PHP code enables to use the latest PHP features for development, yet release the plugin with its code converted to an older PHP version for production, as to target a bigger user base.
