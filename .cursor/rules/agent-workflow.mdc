# Agent Workflow Guidelines

## Priority Order
1. "TASK:" directives (see [task-directives.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-directives.mdc))
2. Code generation requests (follow patterns in relevant rule files)
3. General inquiries (reference [instructions.md](mdc:instructions.md))

## Scratchpad Management
Always maintain the scratchpad at [scratchpad.md](mdc:.cursor/scratchpad.md) for any non-trivial task.
