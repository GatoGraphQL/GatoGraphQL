## Introspection

When installing the Gato GraphQL PRO plugin, these custom scalars will always be available for your use to extend the GraphQL schema.

However, please notice that only when a custom scalar type is referenced will it appear on the GraphQL schema, as [defined by the spec for built-in scalars](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Scalars.Built-in-Scalars):

> When returning the set of types from the `__Schema` introspection type, all referenced built-in scalars must be included. If a built-in scalar type is not referenced anywhere in a schema (there is no field, argument, or input field of that type) then it must not be included.
