# Exposing a secure public API

non-PRO:

- Single endpoint vs persisted queries
- Disabling all uneeded modules
    - No mutations? Disable mutations
    - No users? Disable users
        Mention how all types are painfully linked together, so related fields will also get disabled
- Custom endpoints => Obfuscation
- querying-sensitive-data-fields
- Which settings (from table wp_options) and meta values (from tables wp_postmeta, wp_usermeta, wp_commentmeta and wp_taxonomymeta) can be queried must be explicitly defined in the configuration.
