# “Tailored WordPress Automator” Bundle

Automate tasks in your site. The automation action is done by executing a GraphQL persisted query, triggered by:

- Scheduling a WP-Cron event
- Reacting to a WordPress hook
- Chaining after the completion of a previous GraphQL persisted query

As these GraphQL persisted queries can be set as `private`, these tasks will only be executed internally (i.e. they are not exposed to the Internet).

Some automation tasks you can execute are:

- When uploading an image, if it has no description, call the OpenAI API and generate a caption for that image
- If a published post has no thumbnail, automatically create an image with generative AI using the post's title as the prompt, and set it as a post's featured image
- Check if a newly-published post contains some mandatory block and, if not, add it
- Post newly-uploaded images to Instagram
- Send a daily summary of activity in the site to your email
- Send a "happy birthday" email to your users
- Send yourself a reminder to contact a customer, two weeks after a product was sold
- Send a notification to users when their comment was replied to
- Send a welcome email to new users
- Many more...
