# “Easy WordPress Bulk Transform & Update” Bundle

Use GraphQL for data-centric operations, executed in bulk on hundreds of posts on your site with a single operation:

- Replace a string with another string
- Insert a block in all posts
- Replace a thumbnail with another one
- Convert image URLs to source them through a CDN
- Add missing links
- Upload external resources to your WordPress Media Library and reference them locally
- Update metadata
- Much more

GraphQL provides the power of WP-CLI, but making it available already within the wp-admin, without having to produce and deploy PHP code. It helps you save plenty of time too: While crafting a bespoke PHP script could take hours (including development, testing to make sure the PHP script doesn't produce errors on production, and deployment), crafting a GraphQL query will barely take minutes.

And that's for a single transformation; multiply this saving for each needed transformation that may be needed throughout the year, and the overall savings in time can be truly extraordinary.
