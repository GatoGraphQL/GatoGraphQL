# “Responsible WordPress Public API” Bundle

If you need to expose data via a public API in your WordPress site, while being able to sleep at night (knowing that your site is safe), then you need this bundle!

You will be able to:

- Render your WordPress site in headless mode, using the JS framework of your choice
- Give access to your clients to their own data
- Power applications (mobile app, newsletter, etc) fetching data from your WordPress site
- Create a single source of truth for all your content, editing content in a master site only, from which it is distributed to multiple downstream sites

This bundle enhances your public APIs with the following qualities:

**Security:** Grant access to the API to selected users only via Access Control, with granular access, field by field. Validate that the endpoint can only be accessed from a given IP. Create multiple custom endpoints for different clients, customizing access to each of them, making sure that only the relevant data is exposed to each of them.

**Speed:** Cache the response of the GraphQL API via standard HTTP caching, at the browser and intermediate layers between the client and the server (such as a CDN). Avoid installing 3rd-party libraries on the client-side that slow your website down (eg: when accessed from a cheap mobile phone).

**Schema Evolution:** Deprecate fields and inform your users of the changes, already within the wp-admin, without any PHP code.

**Power:** Access and manipulate data with a plethora of fields and directives.

**Control:** Allow teammates to create and configure endpoints.

With the provided extensions in this bundle, creating and configuring public endpoints is super easy, and it only takes minutes.
