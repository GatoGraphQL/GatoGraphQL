# “Unhindered WordPress Emails Notifications” Bundle

Send personalized emails to your users, containing data corresponding to each. Send email notifications to the site's admin. Or send emails to any address.

Send emails in bulk, with a single GraphQL query. Do not be constrained in what data can be added  to the email: If it can be retrieved via GraphQL (eg: user data, post data, metadata, or other), it can be added to the email.

Emails can be composed using Markdown, and be based on templates containing variables, which are dynamically replaced with data.

The email functionality uses WordPress function `wp_mail`, hence any email configuration (such as the SMTP provider) is applied.
