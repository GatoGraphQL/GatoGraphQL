# “All in One Toolbox for WordPress” Bundle

This bundle contains **all of Gato GraphQL extensions**, in a single plugin, allowing you to achieve all superpowers using GraphQL:

- GraphQL as an API
- GraphQL as engine for your app
- GraphQL as dev/admin tool
- GraphQL as translation tool
- GraphQL as HTTP client
- GraphQL as notifications system
- GraphQL as data synchronization tool
- GraphQL as automation tool

In addition to added functionality, this bundle also contains integrations with 3rd-party WordPress plugins, adding support to retrieve/mutate their data via GraphQL.

As new extensions are created and released, they will also be added to this bundle.
