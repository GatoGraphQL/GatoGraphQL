# Release Notes: 2.4

- Added documentation for new PRO field `_strBase64Encode` ([#2673](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/pull/2673))
- Link extensions to the Extensions Reference in gatographql.com ([#2675](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/pull/2675))

### Support Application Passwords ([#2672](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/pull/2672))

It is now possible to use WordPress [Application Passwords](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/05/application-passwords-integration-guide/) to send an authenticated request to the GraphQL endpoint.

For instance, we can pass the application password when executing the `curl` command against the GraphQL server, replacing the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` values:

```bash
curl -i \
  --user "USERNAME:PASSWORD" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ me { name } }"}' \
  https://mysite.com/graphql
```

When using Gato GraphQL PRO, thanks to the newly added `_strBase64Encode` field, we can use GraphQL to execute authenticated HTTP requests against another WordPress site.

The query below receives the username and application password (and the endpoint to connect to), creates the required authentication header (of type "Basic base64encoded(username:password)"), and sends an HTTP request against the GraphQL server, passing the GraphQL query to execute:

```graphql
query GetDataFromExternalWPSite(
  $username: String!
  $appPassword: String!
  $endpoint: URL!
) {
  loginCredentials: _sprintf(
    string: "%s:%s",
    values: [$username, $appPassword]
  )
    @remove

  base64EncodedLoginCredentials: _strBase64Encode(
    string: $__loginCredentials
  )
    @remove

  loginCredentialsHeaderValue: _sprintf(
    string: "Basic %s",
    values: [$__base64EncodedLoginCredentials]
  )
    @remove

  externalHTTPRequestWithUserPassword: _sendGraphQLHTTPRequest(input:{
    endpoint: $endpoint,
    query: """
  
{
  me {
    name
  }
}

    """,
    options: {
      headers: [
        {
          name: "Authorization",
          value: $__loginCredentialsHeaderValue
        }
      ]
    }
  })
}
```
