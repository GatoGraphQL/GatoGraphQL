# Configuration Cache

Internal configuration cache, to store results from expensive operations to disk

---

The cache is stored under the plugin's `wp-content/gato-graphql/cache/operational` folder.

This module improves performance, by storing to disk, and reusing from then on, the model generated by the GraphQL server to resolve the queries
