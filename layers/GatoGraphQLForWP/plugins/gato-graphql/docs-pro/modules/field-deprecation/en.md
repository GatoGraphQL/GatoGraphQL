# Field Deprecation

Fields in GraphQL can be marked as deprecated when they are not deemed necessary by the application anymore.

This module allows us to mark fields as deprecated via a user interface.

## Using a Field Deprecation List

After creating the Field Deprecation List (see next section), we can have the Custom Endpoint and Persisted Query use it by editing the corresponding Schema Configuration, and selecting the item from the list under block "Field Deprecation Lists".

## Creating a Field Deprecation List

Click on the "Field Deprecation Lists" page in the Gato GraphQL menu:

![Field Deprecation Lists](../../images/field-deprecation-lists.png "Field Deprecation Lists")

Then click on "Add New Field Deprecation List" to go to the editor:

![Creating a Field Deprecation List](../../images/field-deprecation-list.png "Creating a Field Deprecation List")

Every Field Deprecation List contains one or many entries, each of them with the following elements:

- The fields to deprecate
- The deprecation reason (to be shown in the GraphQL response when the deprecated field is queried)
