# Exposing Public and Private endpoints

GraphQL is traditionally about exposing a single endpoint, usually under `https://mysite.com/graphql`.

Gato GraphQL expands this notion, allowing us to expose multiple custom endpoints, each of them tailored to some specific need. For instance, we can expose endpoints:

- `/mobile-app` and `/website`
- `/internal` and `/public`
- `/clients` and `/visitors`
- `/development`, `/staging` and `/production`
- `/development-team`, `/testing-team` and `/marketing-team`
- `/client-A`, `/client-B` and `client-Z`
- any combination of them

Gato GraphQL also natively supports Persisted Queries, which are endpoints where the GraphQL query is predefined and stored in the server.

In this recipe there is no code, but suggestions on when to use each endpoint.

üî• **Tips:**

Every endpoint is configured via a [Schema Configuration](https://gatographql.com/guides/use/creating-a-schema-configuration/), where we define:

- Setting the schema as public or private
- Enabling ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù data elements
- Namespacing the schema
- Using nested mutations
- Defining response headers
- Granting access to the schema elements via Access Control Lists
- Setting-up HTTP caching
- Many others

## When to use the single endpoint

The single GraphQL endpoint is always public, exposed by default under `/graphql`.

should be used when 

building headless sites

## When to use public custom endpoints


## When to use private private endpoints

You can also [create your own internal endpoint](https://gatographql.com/guides/config/creating-custom-internal-endpoints-for-blocks/), and pre-define whatever specific configuration required for your blocks (enabling nested mutations, enabling namespacing, defining what CPTs can be queried, or anything else available in the Schema Configuration).

## When to use Persisted Queries

Alternatively, you can create Persisted Queries and retrieve data from them (instead of from an endpoint). Check out how the [client code must be adapted](https://gatographql.com/guides/intro/connecting-to-the-graphql-server-from-a-client/#heading-executing-persisted-queries).
