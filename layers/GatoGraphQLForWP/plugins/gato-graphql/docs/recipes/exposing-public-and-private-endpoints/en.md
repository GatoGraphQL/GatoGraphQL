# Exposing Public and Private endpoints

GraphQL is traditionally about exposing a single endpoint, usually under `https://mysite.com/graphql`.

Gato GraphQL expands this, allowing us to expose multiple endpoints, each of them tailored to some specific needs. For instance, we can expose endpoints "clients" and "visitors", "development-team" and "everyone-else", "client-A/B/C/D/Z", or anything else.

In this recipe there is no code, but suggestions on when to use each endpoint.
