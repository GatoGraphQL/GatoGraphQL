- Automate tasks
- Complement WP-CLI to execute admin tasks
- Search/replace content for site migrations
- Send notifications when something happens (new post published, new comment added, etc)
- Interact with cloud services
- Convert the data from a 3rd-party API into the required format
- Translate content in the site
- Insert or remove (Gutenberg) blocks in bulk
- Validate that a new post contains a mandatory block
- And much more...

The links in this section showcase use cases and best practices for this tool, and demonstrate GraphQL queries to achieve each objective.
