# Building headless sites

Must enable the single endpoint

It can be used with any framework

	Create recipe "Single Endpoint vs Custom Endpoints"
		Ideas:
			By default, don't be protective, so private schema has access to everything
			Indicate that Single Endpoint is only for private environments
				Otherwise create a Custom Endpoint!!!
			And let everyone configure everything through SchemaConfig
