Transform your WordPress site into a modern GraphQL server: [gatographql.com](https://gatographql.com).

![The interactive schema visualizer](docs/images/interactive-schema.png)

This plugin is the implementation for WordPress of [GraphQL by PoP](https://graphql-by-pop.com/), a CMS-agnostic GraphQL server in PHP.

<!-- ## Why

Please read the author's [introduction to Gato GraphQL](https://leoloso.com/posts/introducing-the-gato-graphql-for-wordpress/), which describes:

- How does it compare with the existing solutions: WP REST API and WPGraphQL
- An overview of all its features
- Q&A -->

<!-- ## Requirements

- WordPress 5.4 or above
- PHP 8.1+ for development
- PHP 7.1+ for production -->

## Installing the plugin (for production)

üëÄ Instructions: [Installing Gato GraphQL](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/master/docs/installing-gato-graphql-for-wordpress.md).

## Development

<!-- The source code is hosted on the [`leoloso/PoP` monorepo](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP), under [`GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gato-graphql`](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/tree/master/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gato-graphql). -->

üëÄ Instructions: [Setting-up the development environment](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/master/docs/development-environment.md).

### Supported PHP features

Check the list of [Supported PHP features](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/master/docs/supported-php-features.md)

### Gutenberg JS builds

Compiled JavaScript code (such as all files under a block's `build/` folder) is added to the repo, but only as compiled for production, i.e. after running `npm run build`.

Code compiled for development, i.e. after running `npm start`, cannot be commited/pushed to the repo.

<!-- ### Building static sites

Gato GraphQL provides non-restrictive default settings, which simplify the configuration for building "static" sites.

This is how the restrictive and non-restrictive default behaviors compare:

| Feature | Restrictive behavior | Non-restrictive behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single endpoint | Disabled | Enabled |
| ‚ÄúSensitive‚Äù data fields | Not added to the schema | Added to the schema |
| Settings from `wp_options` | Only a few predefined options are queryable | All options are queryable |
| Meta (posts, users, comments, taxonomies) | No keys are queryable | All keys are queryable |
| Max limit to query entities (posts, users, etc) | Limited | Unlimited |
| Environment Fields | No environment variables or PHP constants are queryable | All environment variables and PHP constants are queryable |
| Send HTTP Request Fields | No URL can be requested | All URLs can be requested |

In development, to enable restrictive defaults, execute:

```bash
composer enable-restrictive-defaults
```

On a site in production, set in `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'GATO_GRAPHQL_SETTINGS_OPTION_ENABLE_RESTRICTIVE_DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR', true );
```

Or define this same key/value as an environment variable. -->

<!-- ### CMS-agnosticism

Even though this plugin is already the implementation for WordPress, it is recommended to develop components following the [CMS-agnostic method employed by GraphQL by PoP](https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/architecture/cms-agnosticism.html), so that they can benefit from architectural optimizations and future developments.

In particular, support for serverless PHP (a feature which is [on the roadmap](https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/roadmap/serverless-wordpress.html)) may require to decouple the codebase from WordPress.

This method requires the code for the component to be divided into 2 separate packages:

- A CMS-agnostic package, containing the business code and generic contracts, but without using any WordPress code (eg: [posts](https://github.com/PoPSchema/posts))
- A CMS-specific package, containing the implementation of the contracts for WordPress (eg: [posts-wp](https://github.com/PoPSchema/posts-wp)) -->
