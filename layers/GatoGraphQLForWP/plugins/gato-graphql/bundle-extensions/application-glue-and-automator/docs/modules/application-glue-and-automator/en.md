# “Application Glue & Automator” Bundle

This bundles gives you a toolbox for interacting with your data, and create workflows to automate tasks:

- Keep content in sync, whether within the same site, or across multiple WordPress sites
- Help migrate websites from one domain to another
- Validate that a newly-published blog post contains mandatory blocks
- Send a notification whenever a new comment is added
- Send a welcome email to new users
- Do a bulk replace of one (Gutenberg) block with another
- Interact with cloud services
- Convert data from 3rd-party APIs into the required format
- Many more...

All this power comes without endangering your site: An internal GraphQL server is provided, so you don't need to expose an endpoint over the Internet just to execute your own admin tasks.
