/**
 * There are three stages for the main plugin, and for each extension plugin:
 * `setup`, `initialize` and `boot`.
 *
 * This is because:
 *
 * - The plugin must execute its logic before the extensions
 * - The services can't be booted before all services have been initialized
 *
 * To attain the needed order, we execute them using hook "plugins_loaded":
 *
 * 1. Gato GraphQL => setup(): immediately (not on "plugins_loaded")
 * 2. System => handleNewActivations(): priority 90 (before container is to be created)
 * 3. Gato GraphQL extensions => setup(): priority 100
 * 4. Gato GraphQL => initialize(): priority 110
 * 5. Gato GraphQL extensions => initialize(): priority 120
 * 6. Gato GraphQL => bootSystem(): priority 130
 * 7. Gato GraphQL => configure(): priority 140
 * 8. Gato GraphQL extensions => configure(): priority 150
 * 9. Gato GraphQL => bootApplication(): priority 160
 * 10. Gato GraphQL => boot(): priority 170
 * 11. Gato GraphQL extensions => boot(): priority 180
 * 12. After everything: priority 190
