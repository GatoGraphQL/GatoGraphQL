By caching it to disk, the server can reuse an already-generated schema from a previous introspection request, thus improving speed.</p> <h2 id="when-it-is-disabled">When it is disabled</h2> <p>Caching the introspection schema is disabled when the API is private, because the schema metadata can change depending on the context (eg: some users can be denied access to some field).</p> <p>If the API is public, though, the schema metadata is unique, and available to everyone, hence it can be safely cached.</p> <p>As a consequence, this module <code>Schema Introspection Cache</code> can only be enabled when module <code>Public/Private Schema</code> is disabled.</p> '}}]);
