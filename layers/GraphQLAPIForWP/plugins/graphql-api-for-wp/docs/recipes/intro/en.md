# Intro

The GraphQL API is a **productivity tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site**. Among others, it allows you to:

- Query data to create headless sites
- Expose public or private APIs
- Synchronize content across sites
- Automate tasks
- Complement WP-CLI to execute admin tasks
- Search/replace content for site migrations
- ...and much more

Click on the links in this section to learn about use cases for this tool and several best practices (including for GraphQL in general).

Whenever appropriate, GraphQL queries (and additional PHP code, setups, integrations and others) are included; copy/paste them in your own persisted queries, to help you achieve your goals faster.
