# Intro

The GraphQL API is a **productivity tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site**. Among others, it allows you to:

- Query data to create headless sites
- Expose public or private APIs
- Synchronize content across sites
- Automate tasks
- Complement WP-CLI to execute admin tasks
- Search/replace content for site migrations
- ...and much more

In this section, you can browse documentation explaining when you can use this tool and what's the best way to use it (and also GraphQL in general), and many recipes (involving GraphQL queries) to help you achieve your goals.
