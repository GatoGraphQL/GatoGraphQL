# Schema Settings

Retrieve the settings from the site (stored in table `wp_options`), by querying field `option`.

For security reasons, which options can be queried must be explicitly configured.

By default, only the following options can be queried:

- `"home"`
- `"blogname"`
- `"blogdescription"`

## How to use

Query field `Root.option`, passing the required option as field argument `name`.

For instance, this query retrieves the site's URL:

```graphql
{
  option(name: "home")
}
```

## Configure the allowed options

In the "Schema Settings" tab from the Settings, we must configure the list of options that can be queried via `option`.

Each entry can either be:

- A regex (regular expression), if it's surrounded by `/`, or
- The full option name, otherwise

For instance, both entries `siteurl` and `/site.*/` match option name `"siteurl"`.
