# Release Notes: 0.8

This is a huge release, which focuses on three areas:

1. Refactoring the codebase to enable extensions
2. Further satisfying the GraphQL specification
3. Completing the GraphQL schema

In addition, it supports the new WordPress 5.8, and contains plenty of bug fixes.

## Support for WordPress 5.8

WordPress 5.8 [deprecates several filter hooks](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/1118), including `allowed_block_types` and `block_categories` (used by this plugin).

The affected hooks have been replaced:

1. `allowed_block_types` => `allowed_block_types_all`
2. `block_categories` => `block_categories_all`

## Improved support for PHP 8.0

This release fixes a few issues when using PHP 8.0.

## Simplified the codebase, using container services everywhere

The codebase for the GraphQL server has been refactored, to use a service container for registering all elements for the schema (type resolvers, field resolvers, interface resolvers, custom scalar resolvers, and others).

This is a milestone, which introduces a single approach for developing the plugin and its extensions, greatly simplifying their code and documentation.

Docs on how to create custom extensions for the GraphQL API can finally be written. They will soon be available on [graphql-api.com/guides](https://graphql-api.com/guides).

## Cache is saved under the plugin folder

The plugin caches results to disk to optimize performance.

The cached files were previously stored under a system folder, out of view to the admin user. From now on, they are stored under `wp-content/graphql-api/cache/`.

## A "fixed schema" GraphQL endpoint was introduced to power the WordPress editor

Now, there are 2 endpoints in the `wp-admin`:

1. `GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_CONFIGURABLESCHEMA_ENDPOINT`
2. `GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_FIXEDSCHEMA_ENDPOINT`

With **`GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_CONFIGURABLESCHEMA_ENDPOINT`**, the GraphQL schema is modified by user preferences, such as being namespaced or not, having types/directives enabled or not, and others.

With **`GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_FIXEDSCHEMA_ENDPOINT`**, the GraphQL schema is not modified by user preferences, always exposing all types, fields and directives, including the "unrestricted" admin fields.

This latter endpoint enables Gutenberg blocks to query all fields, independently of those being enabled or not by the user, and with unrestricted access.

## Further support of field types in the schema

Support for lists as field types has been expanded, now supporting the following features:

- Lists with non-null items: `[String!]`
- Lists of lists: `[[String]]`
- Any combination of them: `[[String!]!]`

## Input coercion: accept a single value when a list is expected

We can now input a single value in the GraphQL query where a list is expected, as [defined in the GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-List.Input-Coercion).

For instance, this query:

```graphql
{
  posts(ids: 1) {
    title
  }
}
```

...is equivalent to:

```graphql
{
  posts(ids: [1]) {
    title
  }
}
```

## Further completed the WordPress schema

Additional entities from the WordPress data model have been added to the GraphQL schema:

<a href="../../images/graphql-schema-v08.png" target="_blank">![GraphQL schema](../../images/graphql-schema-v08.png)</a>

Let's see what new elements have been added.

### Categories

Categories have been mapped, via the new `PostCategory` type, and the new fields:

- `Root.postCategories: [PostCategory]`
- `Root.postCategory: PostCategory`
- `Post.categories: [PostCategory]`

For instance, this query retrieves the categories for the posts:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
    categories {
      id
      name
      url
    }
  }
}
```

A mutation field, to assign categories to posts, has also been added:

- `MutationRoot.setCategoriesOnPost: Post`

And an input `categories` has been added to the mutation fields for posts:

- `MutationRoot.createPost`
- `MutationRoot.updatePost`
- `Post.update` (when nested mutations are enabled)

### Menus

Menus have been mapped, via the new `Menu` type, and the new field `Root.menu`.

### Settings

The settings from the site (stored in table `wp_options`) can be queried via the new field `Root.option: AnyScalar`.

For instance, this query retrives the site's name:

```graphql
{
  siteName: option(name: "blogname")
}
```

Which options can be accessed must be explicitly configured in the settings page:

<a href="../../images/schema-configuration-settings-entries.jpg" target="_blank">![Defining the entries for the Settings](../../images/schema-configuration-settings-entries.jpg "Defining the entries for the Settings")</a>

By default, only the following options can be queried:

- `"home"`
- `"blogname"`
- `"blogdescription"`

### User posts

Logged-in users can retrieve their own posts, for any status (`publish`, `pending`, `draft` or `trash`), via the new fields:

- `Root.myPosts: [Post]`
- `Root.myPostCount: Int`
- `Root.myPost: Post`

For instance, we can now run this query:

```graphql
{
  myPosts {
    id
    title
    url
    status
  }
}
```

## Added "unrestricted" admin fields to the GraphQL schema (disabled by default)

The GraphQL schema must strike a balance between public and private fields, as to avoid exposing private information in a public API.

The new module "Schema for the Admin" adds "unrestricted" admin fields to the GraphQL schema, which may expose private data:

**Root:**

- `unrestrictedPost`
- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`
- `unrestrictedCustomPost`
- `unrestrictedCustomPosts`
- `unrestrictedCustomPostCount`
- `unrestrictedPage`
- `unrestrictedPages`
- `unrestrictedPageCount`
- `roles`
- `capabilities`

**User:**

- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`
- `unrestrictedCustomPosts`
- `unrestrictedCustomPostCount`
- `roles`
- `capabilities`

**PostCategory:**

- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`

**PostTag:**

- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`

For instance, to access post data, currently we have field `posts`, which exposes public data only, by fetching published posts.

With this module enabled, we can also access post data via field `unrestrictedPosts`, which exposes public and private data, by fetching posts with any status (`"publish"`, `"draft"`, `"pending"`, `"trash"`).

Due to security reasons, this module is disabled by default.

## Introduced scalar type `AnyScalar`

Scalar type `AnyScalar` represents any of the built-in scalars (`String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `Float` or `ID`).

It is used on the newly-introduced `option` field, because we do not know in advance the type of its returned data, and the union of scalar types is currently not supported by the GraphQL spec.

<!-- While there may be a type mismatch error on the client (such as GraphiQL), the GraphQL server will handle the conversion (such as from `String` to `AnyScalar` and vice-versa) without any problem. -->

<!-- `AnyScalar` simplifies the GraphQL schema. It is needed because WordPress functions `get_option`, `get_post_meta`, `get_user_meta`, and others, can store data of any type: boolean, string, int, etc. -->
