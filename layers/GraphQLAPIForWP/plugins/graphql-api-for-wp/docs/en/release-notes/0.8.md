# Release Notes: 0.8

## Further completed the WordPress schema

The GraphQL schema has been significantly completed:

<a href="../../images/graphql-schema-v08.png" target="_blank">![GraphQL schema](../../images/graphql-schema-v08.png)</a>

Let's see what new elements have been added.

### Categories

Categories have been mapped, via the new `PostCategory` type, and the new fields:

- `Root.postCategories: [PostCategory]`
- `Root.postCategory: PostCategory`
- `Post.categories: [PostCategory]`

For instance, this query retrieves the categories for the posts:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
    categories {
      id
      name
      url
    }
  }
}
```

A mutation field, to assign categories to posts, has also been added:

- `MutationRoot.setCategoriesOnPost: Post`

And an input `categories` has been added to the mutation fields for posts:

- `MutationRoot.createPost`
- `MutationRoot.updatePost`
- `Post.update` (when nested mutations are enabled)

### Menus

Menus have been mapped, via the new `Menu` type, and the new field `Root.menu`.

### Meta

Custom post, user, comment and taxonomy meta values can now be queried, via the new fields:

- `Post.metaValue: Mixed`
- `Post.metaValues: [Mixed]`
- `User.metaValue: Mixed`
- `User.metaValues: [Mixed]`
- `Comment.metaValue: Mixed`
- `Comment.metaValues: [Mixed]`
- `PostCategory.metaValue: Mixed`
- `PostCategory.metaValues: [Mixed]`
- `PostTag.metaValue: Mixed`
- `PostTag.metaValues: [Mixed]`

For instance, this query retrieves the meta `last_name` for the users:

```graphql
{
  users {
    id
    lastName: metaValue(key: "last_name")
  }
}
```

Since meta value can be anything (string, integer, float, boolean, array, or null) they have been mapped via the generic type `Mixed`.

The modules adding the meta fields to the GraphQL schema are disabled by default, so they must be enabled:

- Schema Custom Post Meta
- Schema User Meta
- Schema Comment Meta
- Schema Taxonomy Meta

Meta values may be public or private. Which meta keys can be queried must be explicitly configured in the settings page. By default, the list of allowed meta keys is empty.

### Settings

The settings from the site (stored in table `wp_options`) can be queried via the new field `Root.option: Mixed`.

For instance, this query retrives the site's name:

```graphql
{
  siteName: option(name: "blogname")
}
```

### User posts

Logged-in users can retrieve their own posts, for any status (`publish`, `pending`, `draft` or `trash`), via the new fields:

- `Root.myPosts: [Post]`
- `Root.myPostCount: Int`
- `Root.myPost: Post`

For instance, we can now run this query:

```graphql
{
  myPosts {
    id
    title
    url
    status
  }
}
```

## Added "unrestricted" admin fields to the GraphQL schema (disabled by default)

The GraphQL schema must strike a balance between public and private fields, as to avoid exposing private information in a public API.

The new module "Schema for the Admin" adds "unrestricted" admin fields to the GraphQL schema, which may expose private data:

**Root:**

- `unrestrictedPost`
- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`
- `unrestrictedCustomPost`
- `unrestrictedCustomPosts`
- `unrestrictedCustomPostCount`
- `unrestrictedPage`
- `unrestrictedPages`
- `unrestrictedPageCount`
- `roles`
- `capabilities`

**User:**

- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`
- `unrestrictedCustomPosts`
- `unrestrictedCustomPostCount`
- `roles`
- `capabilities`

**PostCategory:**

- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`

**PostTag:**

- `unrestrictedPosts`
- `unrestrictedPostCount`

For instance, to access post data, currently we have field `posts`, which exposes public data only, by fetching published posts.

With this module enabled, we can also access post data via field `unrestrictedPosts`, which exposes public and private data, by fetching posts with any status (`"publish"`, `"draft"`, `"pending"`, `"trash"`).

Due to security reasons, this module is disabled by default.

## Composable directives

Through composable directives, we can modify or augment the behavior of directives. This is useful since, often times, a directive cannot be applied on the field, because it has an input which is different than the field's output.

For instance, `User.capabilities` returns `[String]` (an array of strings), and directive `@upperCase` receives `String`. Hence, executing the following query returns an error due to the type mismatch:

```graphql
{
  users {
    capabilities @upperCase
  }
}
```

A nested directive can fill the gap between these two types, transforming the output from the field into the required input for the directive.

For instance, directive `@forEach` can iterate over an array of elements, and apply its nested directive on each of them. The query from above can be satisfied like this (where param `nestedUnder` indicates the relative position of the parent directive):

```graphql
{
  users {
    capabilities
      @forEach
        @upperCase(nestedUnder: -1)
  }
}
```

Composable directives keep the schema clean and elegant, allowing the minimum set of elements to satisfy a great amount of functionality.

This functionality is an opt-in, because it is non-standard (it is not part of the GraphQL spec).

## Simplified the codebase, using container services everywhere

The codebase for the GraphQL server has been refactored, to use a service container for registering all elements for the schema (type resolvers, field resolvers, interface resolvers, and others).

This is a milestone, which introduces a single approach for developing the plugin and its extensions, greatly simplifying their code and documentation.

(Docs on how to create custom extensions for the GraphQL API will soon be published on [graphql-api.com/guides](https://graphql-api.com/guides).)

## Cache is saved under the plugin folder

The plugin provides several levels of caching (for the service container, configuration, and schema) to optimize performance.

The cached files were stored under a system folder, out of view to the admin user.

Now, the cached files are stored under the plugin's folder, under `cache/`. This way, they become visible, and will be automatically deleted when installing a new version of the plugin.

## Improved support for PHP 8.0

This release fixes a few issues when using PHP 8.0.

## The WordPress editor can access configurable/fixed GraphQL endpoints, to power Gutenberg blocks

Now, there are 2 endpoints in the wp-admin:

1. `GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_CONFIGURABLESCHEMA_ENDPOINT`
2. `GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_FIXEDSCHEMA_ENDPOINT`

With **`GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_CONFIGURABLESCHEMA_ENDPOINT`**, the GraphQL schema is modified by user preferences (such as being namespaced or not, having types/directives enabled or not, and others).

With **`GRAPHQL_API_ADMIN_FIXEDSCHEMA_ENDPOINT`**, the GraphQL schema is not modified by user preferences, always exposing all types, fields and directives (including the "unrestricted" admin fields).
