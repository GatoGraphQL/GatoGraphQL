Transform your WordPress site into a modern GraphQL server: [graphql-api.com](https://graphql-api.com).

![The interactive schema visualizer](docs/images/interactive-schema.png)

This plugin is the implementation for WordPress of [GraphQL by PoP](https://graphql-by-pop.com/), a CMS-agnostic GraphQL server in PHP.

<!-- ## Why

Please read the author's [introduction to the GraphQL API for WordPress](https://leoloso.com/posts/introducing-the-graphql-api-for-wordpress/), which describes:

- How does it compare with the existing solutions: WP REST API and WPGraphQL
- An overview of all its features
- Q&A -->

<!-- ## Requirements

- WordPress 5.4 or above
- PHP 8.0+ for development
- PHP 7.1+ for production -->

## Installing the plugin (for production)

ðŸ‘€ Instructions: [Installing the GraphQL API for WordPress plugin](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/master/docs/installing-graphql-api-for-wordpress.md).

## Development

<!-- The source code is hosted on the [`leoloso/PoP` monorepo](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP), under [`GraphQLAPIForWP/plugins/graphql-api-for-wp`](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/tree/master/layers/GraphQLAPIForWP/plugins/graphql-api-for-wp). -->

ðŸ‘€ Instructions: [Setting-up the development environment](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/master/docs/development-environment.md).

### Supported PHP features

Check the list of [Supported PHP features](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/master/docs/supported-php-features.md)

### Gutenberg JS builds

Compiled JavaScript code (such as all files under a block's `build/` folder) is added to the repo, but only as compiled for production, i.e. after running `npm run build`.

Code compiled for development, i.e. after running `npm start`, cannot be commited/pushed to the repo.

<!-- ### CMS-agnosticism

Even though this plugin is already the implementation for WordPress, it is recommended to develop components following the [CMS-agnostic method employed by GraphQL by PoP](https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/architecture/cms-agnosticism.html), so that they can benefit from architectural optimizations and future developments.

In particular, support for serverless PHP (a feature which is [on the roadmap](https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/roadmap/serverless-wordpress.html)) may require to decouple the codebase from WordPress.

This method requires the code for the component to be divided into 2 separate packages:

- A CMS-agnostic package, containing the business code and generic contracts, but without using any WordPress code (eg: [posts](https://github.com/PoPSchema/posts))
- A CMS-specific package, containing the implementation of the contracts for WordPress (eg: [posts-wp](https://github.com/PoPSchema/posts-wp)) -->

## Modules
