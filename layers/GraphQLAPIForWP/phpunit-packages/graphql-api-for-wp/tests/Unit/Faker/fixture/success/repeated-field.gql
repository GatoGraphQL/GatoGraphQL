# Test that querying a same field twice,
# for the same type and ID twice, works.
#
# To take into account are:
#
# - Caching: are the fields re-calculated, or taken from a cache?
# - Uniqueness: are the fields considered the same, or different?
#   (They are placed in different locations)
# - Serialization: The object (eg: DateTime) must be converted
#   to string for the output. Is this done OK on the second field?

{
  post(by:{ id: 1724 }) {
    title # Type: String
    date # Type: DateTime <= requires serialization
  }
  again: post(by:{ id: 1724 }) {
    title
    date
  }
