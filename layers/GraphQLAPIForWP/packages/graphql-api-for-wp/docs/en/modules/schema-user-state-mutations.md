# Schema User State Mutations

Have the user log-in, and be able to perform mutations

## Description

This module provides the functionality needed to log the user in, which is in most cases required to perform mutations.

Disabling this module makes all "schema mutation" modules which require user state (such as for creating a post, uploading media, etc) also get disabled.
