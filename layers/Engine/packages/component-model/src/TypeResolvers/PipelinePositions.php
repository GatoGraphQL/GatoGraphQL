/**
 * Define where to place the directive in the directive execution pipeline
 *
 * 3 directives are mandatory, and executed in this order:
 *
 *   1. Validate: to validate that the schema, fieldNames, etc are supported, and filter them out if not
 *   2. ResolveAndMerge: to resolve the field and place the data into the DB object
 *   3. SerializeLeafOutputTypeValues: to serialize Scalar and Enum Type values
 *
 * All other directives must indicate where to position themselves,
 * using these 3 directives as anchors.
 *
 * There are 7 positions:
 *
 *   1. At the very beginning
 *   2. Before the PrepareField directive
 *   3. Between the PrepareField and Validate directives
 *   4. Between the Validate and Resolve directives
 *   5. Between the Resolve and Serialize directives
 *   6. After the Serialize directive
 *   7. At the very end
 *
 * In the "serialize" step, the directive takes the objects
 * stored in $resolvedIDFieldValues, such as a DateTime object,
 * and converts them to string for printing in the response.
