/**
 * Class to retrieve the values contained in Field Arguments.
 *
 * It transforms the FieldArgs passed in the GraphQL query, into the "normalized"
 * values that will be used when resolving the query. These include:
 *
 * - The default values that were not provided in the GraphQL query
 * - Coercing values according to the schema definition
 * - Potential custom additions of values into the FieldArgs, such as the
 *   logged-in user's name and email when adding comments
 *
 * There are 3 possibilities for hosting Field Argument values:
 *
 * 1. Data from a Field in an ObjectTypeResolver: a single instance of the
 *    FieldArgs will satisfy all queried objects, since the same schema applies
 *    to all of them.
 *
 * 2. Data from a Field in an UnionTypeResolver: the union field does not have
 *    the schema information, but only the corresponding ObjectTypeResolver
 *    that will resolve the entity does.
 *    For instance, when querying 'customPosts { dateStr }', field `dateStr`
 *    could be evaluated against a Post or Page types, and they could have
 *    different definitions of the `dateStr` field, such as making argument
 *    `$format` mandatory or not. Then, there will be a different FieldArgs
 *    produced for each targetObjectTypeResolver in the UnionTypeResolver
 *
 * 3. Data for a specific object: When executing nested mutations, the FieldArgs
 *    for each object will be different, as it will contain implicit information
 *    belonging to the object.
 *    For instance, when querying `mutation { posts { update(title: "New title") { id } } }`,
 *    the value for the `$postID` is injected into the FieldArgs for each object,
 *    and the validation of the FieldArgs must also be executed for each object.
 *
 * To satisfy all 3 cases with a single implementation, all data is stored
 * in a chained SplObjectStorage that organizes data by:
 *
 * 1. The Field
 * 2. The ObjectTypeResolver: directly the same ObjectTypeResolver when coming from there,
 *    or each of the targetObjectTypeResolvers when coming from an UnionTypeResolver
 * 3. The object, or a special "wildcard object" to signify "all objects"
