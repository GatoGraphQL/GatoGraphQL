# PoP Engine

This repo concerns the component-model architecture.

## Description
 
PoP describes an architecture based on a server-side component model, designed as a set of PHP packages distributed through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). 

The core packages are:

- [Component Model](packages/component-model): Implementation of the basic component model, dealing with component data (but no configuration)
- [Engine](packages/engine): Adds services over the component model

PoP is components all the way down. Each component is implemented partly in the back-end, and partly in the front-end. The component-based architecture provides the mechanism to build, configure and even deploy the application (eg: by providing support for the serverless paradigm). 

![In PoP, everything is a component](https://uploads.getpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/everything-is-a-module.jpg)

### CMS-agnostic, based on contracts

PoP relies on contracts to interact with the underlying CMS or framework, where all logic resides. As such, it is CMS-agnostic, and it can work with any PHP-based CMS or framework (WordPress, Symfony, Laravel, Joomla, Drupal). 

<!-- So far only the [contracts for WordPress](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP-API-WP) have been implemented, but extending it to any other platform is very simple: Only all the [repos ending on `"-wp"`](https://github.com/getpop?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=-wp&type=&language=), which contain the implementation of the contracts for WordPress, need be re-implemented. -->

### No creeping business logic

PoP doesn't implement any business logic, and doesn't attempt to re-invent the wheel: Authentication, CRUD operations, validation, etc are all implemented by the CMS; PoP is simply a layer which makes use of all this already-existing functionality, and makes it easily available to the application.

### Design goals

PoP's architecture attempts to achieve the following goals:

✅ High level of modularity:

- Strict top-down component hierarchy: Ancestor components know their descendants, but not the other way around
- One-way setting of props across components, from ancestors to descendants
- Configuration values are set through an API instead of through the application

✅ Minimal effort to produced a maximum output:

- Isomorphism of code
- Output for different applications (website, mobile app, emails, etc)

✅ Maintainable/Easy to debug and fix:

- Modules are focused on a single task or goal

✅ Aggressive caching, implemented across several layers: 

- Server-side caching
- HTTP caching
- Asset caching and, in addition, content-caching through CDN, service workers and local storage in client

✅ Deployable on serverless PHP

- Server-side components are the perfect mechanism to execute atomic operations on a serverless environment

✅ Self documentation: 

- Component pattern libraries are automatically generated by rendering each component on their own

<!--
✅ JavaScript as progressive enhancement (the application works always, even if JavaScript is disabled)

✅ The API and the application share the same architecture/foundations

✅ Support for creating all-purpose APIs, compatible with both REST and GraphQL, and offering the benefits of both these APIs at the same time

✅ Clearly decoupled responsibilities in the stack, which defines clear responsibilities across team members. Eg:

- JavaScript templates for markup
- JavaScript for user interactivity/dynamic functionality
- CSS for styles
- PHP for creating the components

## Architecture foundations

The architecture establishes the following foundations:

1. Everything is a component (also called component)
2. The component is its own API
<!--
3. The API and the application use the same code
-->
**1. Everything is a component**

A PoP application contains a top-most component (also called a component) which wraps other components, which themselves wrap other components, and so on until reaching the last level:

![Sequence of components wrapping components wrapping components, from an avatar all the way up to the webpage](https://uploads.getpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/module-sequence.gif)

Hence, in PoP everything is a component, and the top-most component represents the page.

**2. The component is its own API**

Every component, at whichever level inside the component hierarchy (i.e. the composition of components starting from the top-most, all the way down to the last level), is independently accessible simply by passing along its component path in the URL: `/page-url/?output=json&componentFilter=componentpaths&componentpaths[]=path-to-the-component`
<!--
**3. The API and the application use the same code**

In PoP, the application consumes its data from itself. Indeed, the application and the API are the same entity, so there is no code duplication whatsoever (eg: for user authentication). Moreover, the application can consume the data already on the server-side, avoiding the extra latency from consuming data on the client-side.
-->
### Progressive/Resilient components

In most libraries/frameworks in the market, the implementation of the concept of components is based on JavaScript. In PoP, a component has a progressive approach, and its implementation spans from back to front-end:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Back-end</th><th>Front-end</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr valign="top"><td>
Component hierarchy<br/>
Data loading<br/>
Configuration<br/>
Props
</td><td>
Styles<br/>
View<br/>
Reactivity
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<!--
## Open specification

PoP is in the process of decoupling the API specification from the implementation, resulting in the following parts:

1. The API (JSON response) specification
2. PoP Server, to serve content based on the API specification (originally implemented in PHP)
3. PoP.js, to consume the native PoP API in the client

Through the open specification, we hope this architecture can be migrated to other technologies (eg: Node.js, Java, .NET, etc), enabling any site implementing the specification to be able to interact with any other such site. 
-->
<!--
### CMS-agnostic

Because it was originally conceived for WordPress, PoP's current implementation is in PHP, which can be perfectly used for other PHP-based CMSs (such as Joomla or Drupal). For this reason, we are transforming the codebase to make PoP become CMS-agnostic, splitting plugins into 2 entities: a generic implementation that should work for every CMS (eg: "pop-engine") and a specific one for WordPress (eg: "pop-engine-wp"), so that only the latter one should be re-implemented for other CMSs. 

> Note: This task is a work in progress and nowhere near completion: plenty of code has been implemented following the WordPress architecture (eg: basing the object model on posts, pages and custom post types), and must be assessed if it is compatible for other CMSs.
-->

## Response specification

The output from requesting a URL can contain several layers: At its core it is a data layer (enough for [implementing an API](https://github.com/PoP-PoPAPI/api)), which can be further extended by a configuration layer (to implement a website).

### 1. Data layer

The data layer represents data in the following way:

- Database data is retrieved through a relational structure under section `databases`
- The IDs which are the results for each component are indicated through entry `dbobjectids` (under section `datasetcomponentdata`)
- Where to find those results in the database is indicated through entry `dbkeys` (under section `componentsettings`)
- All database data is normalized (i.e. not repeated)

The API response looks like this:

```javascript
{
  databases: {
    primary: {
      posts: {
        1: {
          author: 7, 
          comments: [88]
        },
        2: {
          recommendedby: [5], 
          comments: [23]
        },
      },
      users: {
        5: {
          name: "Leo"
        },
        7: {
          name: "Pedro"
        },
        18: {
          name: "Romualdo"
        }
      },
      comments: {
        23: {
          author: 7, 
          post_id: 2, 
          content: "Great stuff!"
        },
        88: {
          author: 18, 
          post_id: 1, 
          content: "I love this!"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  datasetcomponentdata: {
    "topcomponent": {
      components: {
        "datacomponent1": {
          dbobjectids: [1], 
        },
        "datacomponent2": {
          dbobjectids: [2], 
        }
      }
    }
  },
  componentsettings: {
    "topcomponent": {
      components: {
        "datacomponent1": {
          dbkeys: {
            id: "posts",
            author: "users",
            comments: "comments"
          }
        },
        "datacomponent2": {
          dbkeys: {
            id: "posts",
            recommendedby: "users",
            comments: "comments"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Configuration layer

The configuration layer can provide those properties and values required to build any kind of application:

```javascript
{
  componentsettings: {
    "topcomponent": {
      components: {
        "layoutpostcomponent": {
          configuration: {
            class: "text-center"
          },
          components: {
            "titlecomponent": {
              configuration: {
                class: "title bg-info",
                htmltag: "h3"
              }
            },
            "postcontentcomponent": {
              configuration: {
                maxheight: "400px"
              },
              components: {
                "authoravatarcomponent": {
                  configuration: {
                    class: "img-thumbnail",
                    maxwidth: "50px"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- ## Success stories

PoP is the foundation for the [GraphQL API for PoP](https://github.com/PoP-PoPAPI/api-graphql), an exceptional implementation of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) which supports features not typically supported in GraphQL: HTTP caching, composable fields, composable directives, linear complexity time to resolve queries, and native federation and decentralization, among others.

In the near future, PoP will enable to [build websites](https://github.com/getpop/site) and [export them as static](https://github.com/getpop/static-site-generator). -->

<!--
## Use cases for PoP

Among others, PoP is suitable for the following applications:

### 👉🏽 As an API

The [PoP API](https://github.com/PoP-PoPAPI/api) can combine the best of both GraphQL and REST in a single API: no under or over-fetching or data while supporting server-side cache and not being open to DoS attacks. Through extension [GraphQL API](https://github.com/PoP-PoPAPI/api-graphql) the application becomes a GraphQL server, and through extension [REST API](https://github.com/PoP-PoPAPI/api-rest) the application can add custom REST endpoints.

### 👉🏽 As a hybrid dynamic/static website (currently not available)

By using javascript templates, components can be rendered into HTML, as to produce the website. By pre-rendering the components, the website can be partly exported as static. Then, the application is a hybrid: While the dynamic part of the site is handled from the server, the static sections can be served from a CDN.

### 👉🏽 To be deployed on serverless PHP

Components are the perfect mechanism to execute atomic operations on a serverless environment. For instance, WordPress can't run on serverless. However, a standalone component, deployed on serverless, can access the data from the WordPress database and render it for the visitors.

### 👉🏽 To execute any type of operation supported by the CMS

PoP is CMS-agnostic, and can run on top of any CMS and be a proxy to execute its functionality (retrieve data, post data, log the user in, send an email, etc). It is extremely simple to set-up and use: PoP exposes a single URL-based interface to execute the whole functionality.
<!--
### 👉🏽 Homogenize the architecture of the application

The component-based architecture acts as the foundation for the overall application, including accessing data through the API, and implementation of its many features (many of them already provided out of the box, such as code splitting, A/B testing, client-side state management and layout cache).

### 👉🏽 Maximize the output from a small team

The architectural single source of truth makes it possible to produce HTML for the server-side, client-side, transactional emails, and any other desired output, and power more than one application (for instance, a website + a mobile app), allowing a single developer to handle all these tasks.


### 👉🏽 To produce component stylesheets

Component pattern libraries can be automatically generated by rendering each component on its own.
<!--
### 👉🏽 Robust architecture based on splitting a component's responsibilities into server and client-side

Using components as the building unit of a website has many advantages over other methods, such as through templates. Modern frameworks bring the magic of components to the client-side for functionality (such as JavaScript libraries React and Vue) and for styles through component pattern libraries (such as Bootstrap). PoP splits a component's responsibilities into server-side (props, configuration, other) and client-side (view, reactivity), creating a more resilient and robust architecture.

<!--### Avoid (or lessen) JavaScript fatigue

PoP is not a JavaScript framework, but a framework spanning the server and client-side. While developers can add client-side JavaScript to enhance the application, it is certainly not a requirement, and powerful applications can be created with basic knowledge of JavaScript.

### 👉🏽 Publish content to several platforms (web, app, email) with minimal effort

PoP supports the ["Create Once, Publish Everywhere"](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/2009/10/13) strategy to create several a custom output for different mediums or platforms (website, AMP, newsletters, mobile app, etc) from a single source of truth of content. 

### 👉🏽 Decentralize data sources across domains

<!--
PoP supports to set a component as lazy, so that its data is loaded from the client instead of the server, and change the domain from which to fetch the data to any other domain or subdomain, on a component by component basis, which enables to split an application into microservices. In addition, 

PoP allows to establish more than one data source for any component, so a component can aggregate its data from several domains concurrently, as demonstrated by the content aggregator SukiPoP's [feed](https://sukipop.com/en/posts/), [events calendar](https://sukipop.com/en/calendar/) and [user's map](https://sukipop.com/en/users/?format=map).

<!--### Make the most out of cloud services

From the two foundations "everything is a component" and "a component is its own API", we conclude that everything on a PoP site is an API. And since APIs are greatly suitable to take advantage of cloud services (for instance, serving and caching the API response through a CDN), then PoP calls the cloud "home".-->
<!--
## Timeline

Currently, only the 1st layer, data + configuration API, is available in the repository. We are currently working on the 2nd and 3rd layers, client-side rendering and server-side rendering respectively, and these should be ready and available during the 1st quarter of 2019.
-->
<!--
## Motivation

We have been working on it for more than 5 years, and we are still on the early stages of it (or so we hope!) It was created by Leonardo Losoviz as a solution to connect communities together directly from their own websites, offering an alternative to always depending on Facebook and similar platforms.

PoP didn't start straight as a framework, but as a website for connecting environmental movements in Malaysia, called [MESYM](https://www.mesym.com). After developing plenty of social networking features for this website, we became aware that the website code could be abstracted and turned into a framework for implementing any kind of social network. The PoP framework was thus born, after which we launched a few more websites: [TPPDebate](https://my.tppdebate.org) and [Agenda Urbana](https://agendaurbana.org). 

We then worked towards connecting all the platforms together, so each community could own its own data on their website and share it with the other communities, and break away from depending on the mainstream platforms. We implemented the decentralization feature in PoP, and launched the demonstration site [SukiPoP](https://sukipop.com), which aggregates data from these previous websites and enables different community members to interact with each other.

However, at this point PoP was not a progressive framework for building any kind of site, but a framework for building social networks and nothing else. It was all or nothing, certainly not ideal. For this reason, most of 2018 we have been intensively working on transforming PoP into an all-purpose site builder, which led us to design the component-based architecture for the API, split the framework into several layers, and decouple the API specification from the implementation. 

If the open specification succeeds at attracting interest from the development community and eventually gets implemented for other CMSs and technologies, our goal of connecting sites together will have had a big boost. This is the dream that drives us forward and keeps us working long into the night.

<!--
## Examples

### PoP API
-->
<!--
You can play with the PoP API here: https://nextapi.getpop.org. Check the following examples:
-->
<!--
**Requesting specific fields:**

In the following links, data for a resource or collection of resources is fetched as typically done through REST; however, through parameter `query` we can also specify what specific data to retrieve for each resource, avoiding over or underfetching data: 

- A [single post](https://nextapi.getpop.org/posts/a-lovely-tango/?output=json&action=api&query=title,content,datetime) and a [collection of posts](https://nextapi.getpop.org/posts/?output=json&action=api&query=title,content,datetime) adding parameter `query=title,content,datetime`
- A [user](https://nextapi.getpop.org/u/leo/?output=json&action=api&query=name,username,description) and a [collection of users](https://nextapi.getpop.org/users/?output=json&action=api&query=name,username,description) adding parameter `query=name,username,description`

This works for relationships too. For instance, let's say that we want to retrieve a list of posts with fields `"title"` and `"content"`, each post's comments with fields `"content"` and `"date"`, and the author of each comment with fields `"name"` and `"url"`. To achieve this in GraphQL we would implement the following query:

```javascript
query {
  post {
    title
    content
    comments {
      content
      date
      author {
        name
        url
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For PoP, the query is translated into its corresponding "dot syntax" expression, which can then be supplied through parameter `query`. Querying on a "post" resource, this value is:

```javascript
query=title,content,comments.content,comments.date,comments.author.name,comments.author.url
```

Or it can be simplified, using `|` to group all fields applied to the same resource:

```javascript
query=title|content,comments.content|date,comments.author.name|url
```

When executing this query [on a single post](https://nextapi.getpop.org/posts/a-lovely-tango/?output=json&action=api&query=title|content,comments.content|date,comments.author.name|url) we obtain exactly the required data for all involved resources.
-->
<!--
**PoP, GraphQL and REST-like API:**
-->
<!--
We can fetch exactly the required data for all involved resources from a URL, in different formats:

- [PoP native response](https://nextapi.getpop.org/2013/01/11/markup-html-tags-and-formatting/api/?query=title|content,comments.content|date,comments.author.name|url)

<!--

## Installation

Have your WordPress instance running (the latest version of WordPress can be downloaded from [here](https://wordpress.org/download/)). Then copy the contents of folders `/mu-plugins` and `/plugins` under `/wp-content/mu-plugins` and `/wp-content/plugins` respectively, and activate the 11 plugins from this repository:

- pop-cmsmodel
- pop-cmsmodel-wp
- pop-engine
- pop-engine-wp
- pop-examplecomponents
- pop-queriedobject
- pop-queriedobject-wp
- pop-taxonomy
- pop-taxonomy-wp
- pop-taxonomyquery
- pop-taxonomyquery-wp

The first 4 plugins are needed to produce the PoP API, and the 5th plugin (pop-examplecomponents) provides basic implementations of components for all supported hierarchies (home, author, single, tag, page and 404). 

> Note: this way to install PoP is temporary. We are currently introducing Composer to the codebase, which will provide a more convenient way to install PoP. It should be ready sometime in March 2019.

That's it. You can then access PoP's API by adding parameter `output=json` to any URL on the site: https://yoursite.com/?output=json.

![If adding parameter output=json to your site produces a JSON response, then you got it!](https://uploads.getpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/api-json-response.png?)

> Note 1: Currently PoP runs in WordPress only. Hopefully, in the future it will be available for other CMSs and technologies too.

> Note 2: Only the API has been released so far; we are currently implementing the client-side and server-side rendering layers, which should be released during the first quarter of 2019.

> Note 3: The retrieved fields are defined in plugin pop-examplecomponents. You can explore the contents of this plugin, and modify it to bring more or less data.

-->
<!--
## Configuration

PoP allows the configuration of the following properties, set in file wp-config.php:

`USE_COMPONENT_MODEL_CACHE` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Create and re-use a cache of the settings for the requested page.

`COMPACT_RESPONSE_JSON_KEYS` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Compress the keys in the JSON response.

`ENABLE_CONFIG_BY_PARAMS` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Enable to set the application configuration through URL param "config".

`ENABLE_VERSION_BY_PARAMS` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Enable to set the application version through URL param "version".

`POP_SERVER_FAILIFCOMPONENTSDEFINEDTWICE` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Throw an exception if two different components have the same name.

`POP_SERVER_ENABLEEXTRAURISBYPARAMS` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Allow to request extra URIs through URL param "extrauris".

`DISABLE_API` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Disable the custom-querying capabilities of the API.

`EXTERNAL_SITES_RUN_SAME_SOFTWARE` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Indicate if the external sites from which the origin site is fetching data has the same components installed. In this case, the data can be retrieved using the standard methods. Otherwise, it will be done through the custom-querying API.

`FAIL_IF_SUBCOMPONENT_DATALOADER_IS_UNDEFINED` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Whenever switching domain to a field which doesn't have a default dataloader, and without specifying what dataloader to use, throw an exception if `true` or ignore and avoid loading that data if `false`.
-->
<!--
### Decentralization: enabling crossdomain

To have a website consume data coming from other domains, crossdomain access must be allowed. For this, edit your .htaccess file like this:

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      SetEnvIf Origin "http(s)?://(.+\.)?(source-website.com|aggregator-website.com)$" AccessControlAllowOrigin=$0
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin %{AccessControlAllowOrigin}e env=AccessControlAllowOrigin

      Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods GET
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods POST
    </IfModule>

**Important**: For POST operations to work, we need to make sure the user's browser isn't blocking third-party cookies, otherwise [cross-origin credentialed requests will not work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24687313/what-exactly-does-the-access-control-allow-credentials-header-do#24689738). In Chrome, this configuration is set under Settings > Advanced Settings > Privacy > Content Settings > Block third-party cookies and site data.

### Integration between the Content CDN and Service Workers

To allow the website's service-worker.js be able to cache content coming from the content CDN, access to reading the ETag header must be granted:

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Headers ETag
      Header add Access-Control-Expose-Headers ETag
    </IfModule>
-->

Below is a technical summary. For a more in-depth description, please visit [PoP's documentation page](https://getpop.org/en/documentation/overview/).

## What is PoP?

PoP creates [Single-Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) websites, by combining [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) into an [MVC architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) framework:

- Wordpress is the model/back-end
- Handlebars templates are the view/front-end
- the PoP engine is the controller

![How it works](https://uploads.getpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Step-5-640x301.png)

## Design principles

1. PoP provides the WordPress website of its own API:

 - Available via HTTP
 - By adding parameter `output=json` to any URL

2. Decentralized

 - All PoP websites can communicate among themselves
 - Fetch/process data in real time

## What can be implemented with it?

- Niche social networks
- Decentralized websites
- Content aggregators
- Server back-end for mobile apps
- Microservices
- APIs for Wordpress websites

## Installation

We are currently creating scripts to automate the installation process, we expect them to be ready around mid-October 2018.

Until then, we provide a zip file including all code (PoP, WordPress and plugins), and a database dump from the [GetPoP Demo website](https://demo.getpop.org/), to set-up this same site in a quick-and-dirty manner in your localhost. Download the files and read the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/blob/master/install/getpop-demo/install.md).

## Configuration

PoP allows the configuration of the following properties, done in file wp-config.php:

- `USE_APPSHELL` (_true_|_false_): Load an empty Application Shell (or appshell), which loads the page content after loading.

- `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_RENDERING` (_true_|_false_): Disable producing HTML on the server-side for the first-loaded page.

- `USE_CODE_SPLITTING` (_true_|_false_): Load only the .js and .css that is needed on each page and nothing more.

- `USE_PROGRESSIVE_BOOTING` (_true_|_false_): If doing code splitting, load JS resources on 2 stages: critical ones immediately, and non-critical ones deferred, to lower down the Time to Interactive of the application.

- `GENERATE_BUNDLEGROUP_FILES` and `GENERATE_BUNDLE_FILES` (_true_|_false_): (Only if doing code-splitting) When executing the `/generate-theme/` build script, generate a single bundlegroup and/or a series of bundle files for each page on the website containing all resources it needs.

- `GENERATE_BUNDLE_FILES_ON_RUNTIME` (_true_|_false_): (Only if doing code-splitting) Generate the bundlegroup or bundle files on runtime, so no need to pre-generate these.

- `GENERATE_LOADING_FRAME_RESOURCE_MAPPING` (_true_|_false_): (Only if doing code-splitting) Pre-generate the mapping listing what resources are needed for each route in the application, created when executing the `/generate-theme/` build script.

- `ENQUEUE_FILES_TYPE` (_resource_|_bundle_|_bundlegroup_): (Only if doing code-splitting) Choose how the initial-page resources are loaded:

    - "resource": Load the required resources straight
    - "bundle": through a series of bundle files, each of them comprising up to x resources (defined through constant `BUNDLE_CHUNK_SIZE`)
    - "bundlegroup": through a unique bundlegroup file

- `BUNDLE_CHUNK_SIZE` (_int_): (Only if doing code-splitting) How many resources to pack inside a bundle file. Default: 4.

- `POP_SERVER_TEMPLATERESOURCESINCLUDETYPE` (_header_|_body_|_body-inline_): (Only if doing server-side rendering, code-splitting and enqueue type = "resource") Choose how to include those resources depended by a component (mainly CSS styles):

    - "header": Link in the header
    - "body": Link in the body, right before the component HTML
    - "body-inline": Inline in the body, right before the component HTML

- `POP_SERVER_GENERATERESOURCESONRUNTIME` (_true_|_false_): Allow to extract configuration code from the HTML output and into Javascript files on runtime.

- `USE_MINIFIED_RESOURCES` (_true_|_false_): Include the minified version of .js and .css files.

- `USE_BUNDLED_RESOURCES` (_true_|_false_): (Only if not doing code-splitting) Insert script and style assets from a single bundled file.

- `POP_SERVER_USECDNRESOURCES` (_true_|_false_): Whenever available, use resources from a public CDN.

- `INCLUDE_SCRIPTS_AFTER_HTML` (_true_|_false_): If doing server-side rendering, re-order script tags so that they are included only after rendering all HTML.

- `POP_SERVER_REMOVEDATABASEFROMOUTPUT` (_true_|_false_): If doing server-side rendering, remove all database data from the HTML output.

- `POP_SERVER_TEMPLATEDEFINITION_TYPE` (_0_|_1_|_2_): Allows to replace the name of each component with a base36 number instead, to generate a smaller response (around 40%).

    - 0: Use the original name of each component
    - 1: Use both
    - 2: Use the base36 counter number

- `POP_SERVER_TEMPLATEDEFINITION_CONSTANTOVERTIME` (_true_|_false_): When mangling the template names (template definition type is set to 2), use a database of all template definitions, which will be constant over time and shared among different plugins, to avoid errors in the website from accessed pages (localStorage, Service Workers) with an out-of-date configuration.

- `POP_SERVER_TEMPLATEDEFINITION_USENAMESPACES` (_true_|_false_): If the template definition type is set to 2, then we can set namespaces for each plugin, to add before each template definition. It is needed for decentralization, so that different websites can communicate with each other without conflict, mangling all template definitions the same way. (Otherwise, having different plugins activated will alter the mangling counter, and produce different template definitions).

- `USE_COMPONENT_MODEL_CACHE` (_true_|_false_): Create and re-use a cache of the settings of the requested page.

- `POP_SERVER_COMPACTJSKEYS` (_true_|_false_): Common keys from the JSON code sent to the front-end are replaced with a compact string. Output response will be smaller.

- `USE_LOCAL_STORAGE` (_true_|_false_): Save special loaded-in-the-background pages in localStorage, to not have to retrieve them again (until software version changes).

- `ENABLE_CONFIG_BY_PARAMS` (_true_|_false_): Enable to set the application configuration through URL param "config".

`ENABLE_VERSION_BY_PARAMS` (`true`|`false`, default: `false`): Enable to set the application version through URL param "version".

- `DISABLE_JS` (_true_|_false_): Strip the output of all Javascript code.

- `POP_SERVER_USEGENERATETHEMEOUTPUTFILES` (_true_|_false_): Indicates that we are using all the output files produced from running `/generate-theme/` in this environment, namely:

    - resourceloader-bundle-mapping.json
    - resourceloader-generatedfiles.json
    - All `pop-memory/` files

- `LOAD_FRAME_RESOURCES` (_true_|_false_): When generating file `resources.js`, with the list of resources to dynamically load on the client, include those resources initially loaded in the website (through "loading-frame").

### Decentralization: enabling crossdomain

To have a website consume data coming from other domains, crossdomain access must be allowed. For this, edit your .htaccess file like this:

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      SetEnvIf Origin "http(s)?://(.+\.)?(source-website.com|aggregator-website.com)$" AccessControlAllowOrigin=$0
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin %{AccessControlAllowOrigin}e env=AccessControlAllowOrigin

      # Allow for cross-domain setting of cookies, so decentralized log-in also works
      Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods GET
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods POST
    </IfModule>

#### Important

For POST operations to work, we need to make sure the user's browser isn't blocking third-party cookies, otherwise [cross-origin credentialed requests will not work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24687313/what-exactly-does-the-access-control-allow-credentials-header-do#24689738). In Chrome, this configuration is set under Settings > Advanced Settings > Privacy > Content Settings > Block third-party cookies and site data.

### Integration between the Content CDN and Service Workers

To allow the website's service-worker.js be able to cache content coming from the content CDN, access to reading the ETag header must be granted:

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      Header add Access-Control-Allow-Headers ETag
      Header add Access-Control-Expose-Headers ETag
    </IfModule>

## Optimization

_**Important:** Similar to the installation process, there is room for improvement for the optimization process. If you would like to help us, please [check here](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/issues/49)._

PoP allows to mangle, minify and bundle together all required .css, .js and .tmpl.js files (suitable for PROD environment), both at the plug-in and website levels:

- **At the plug-in level** (it generates 1.js + 1 .tmpl.js + 1.css files per plug-in): execute `bash -x plugins/PLUGIN-NAME/build/minify.sh` for each plugin
- **At the website level** (it generates 1.js + 1 .tmpl.js + 1.css files for the whole website): execute `bash -x themes/THEME-NAME/build/minify.sh` for the theme

Executing the `minify.sh` scripts requires the following software (_I'll welcome anyone proposing a better way to do this_):
 
1. [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

 To minify (as to reduce the file size of) JS files

2. [UglifyCSS](https://github.com/fmarcia/UglifyCSS)

 To minify (as to reduce the file size of) CSS files

3. [Google's minimizer Min](https://github.com/mrclay/minify)

 To bundle and minify files. The min webserver must be deployed under http://min.localhost/.

The following environment variables are used in `minify.sh`: `POP_APP_PATH`, `POP_APP_MIN_PATH` and `POP_APP_MIN_FOLDER`. To set their values, for Mac, execute `sudo nano ~/.bash_profile`, then add and save:
    
      export POP_APP_PATH=path to your website (eg: "/Users/john/Sites/PoP")
      export POP_APP_MIN_PATH=path to Google's min website (eg: "/Users/john/Sites/min")
      export POP_APP_MIN_FOLDER=path to folder in min, used for copy files to minimize (eg: "PoP", with the folder being /Users/john/Sites/min/PoP/)

The `minify.sh` script copies all files to minimize under folder `POP_APP_MIN_FOLDER`, from where it minimizes them. The structure of this folder must be created in advance, as follows:
 
 for each theme:
  
      apps/THEME-NAME/css/
      apps/THEME-NAME/js/
      themes/THEME-NAME/css/
      themes/THEME-NAME/js/
     
 for each plug-in:
  
      plugins/PLUGIN-NAME/css/
      plugins/PLUGIN-NAME/js/
