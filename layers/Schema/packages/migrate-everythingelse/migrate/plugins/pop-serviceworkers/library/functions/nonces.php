// we can even keep the user_id as part of the nonce!!!!!
// // Comment Leo 06/08/2017: actually yes, it is needed, because the /add-post/ page is not brought fresh from the server,
// // but it is cached on the /initial-frames/ in the localStorage
// // // Comment Leo 06/08/2017: No need for this anymore, since retrieving the nonce in the topLevelFeedback for each request,

//  * If enabling the Service Workers and caching the html, then we can't enable the nonce control anymore,

//  * So make the nonce a tiny bit longer
